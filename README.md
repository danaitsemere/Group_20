<h1>Question Number One</h1>
Write a program for a Student Record Management System that allows students to access their information using their student ID. The system should enable students to view their academic records, display their course schedule, add new grades for completed courses, calculate their GPA based on these grades, and show an overview of their academic progress.

<h1>Question NUmber Two</h1>
Write a program for a Hotel Management System that allows customers to check available rooms, make bookings, check in, and complete payments. The system should ensure that room assignments do not overlap, preventing multiple bookings for the same room during conflicting periods. It must manage reservations carefully to maintain accurate availability and avoid scheduling conflicts, providing a smooth and reliable experience for both customers and hotel staff.

<h1>Question Number Three</h1>
Write a program for a Theatre Management System that allows individuals to reserve seats, gain admission, and exit the theatre. The system should prevent overlapping reservations, control entry based on seating capacity, and track departures to maintain accurate occupancy. This ensures efficient and orderly management of attendees within the theatre.
