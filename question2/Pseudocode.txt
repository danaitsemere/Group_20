Algorithm:

1. Create empty bookings, rooms list.
2. If a room is available and the check date for booking is greater than the checkout of the room.
3. If the booking’s checkout date is less than the check-in date, the booking is successful.
4. Otherwise create a new booking record with a new booking-id,check-in date and checkout date.
5. If a guest didn’t pay before, record payment status.
6. Otherwise, there is no unpaid booking.
7. If booking is successful and it has been paid, record the booking status to checked -in.
8. If not checking will fail.
9. If the booking exists, then record the booking status to checked out.
